                                        <p>Guardians are a major factor in helping the stream and being there for the community. I can't even begin to imagine what this stream would be like without them! Wait, does this even make any sense? Don't Guardians just want to laser us?!</p>
                                        <p>Either way, since they are such a big help they will ocassionally get rewards such as a free soundtrack, or 100% free requests in the automated request system. Legends tell there might even be better rewards once the stream owner can afford them...</p>
